    "The material used (Aluminium) has a yield strength of $\\sigma_y = 400 \\, [\\mathrm{MPa}]$. Given a safety factor of 2, the maxixum stress accettable in the structure is $\\sigma_{{max}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma_y = 200 \\, [\\mathrm{MPa}]$. Optimize the truss section so that the maximum stress in the structure is attained but not exceeded. Use the first load case for this study."
